Details of Code:

Hmwk 3 P1 Matlab:

Solves arc length method for the 1D system. 
Plots out the load factor vs displacement, |R| vs Iterations and |R| vs arc length.

Hmwk 3 P2 Matlab: 

Solves arc length method for the 2D system. 
Plots out the load factor vs displacement.

Hmwk 3 P3 Matlab: 

Solves arc length method for the 2D 11 story truss. 
Plots out the load factor vs displacement for the top right and left nodes
Plots a node trace of the top nodes to point where on of the nodes touches the floor

Assemble Matlab:

Assembles stiffness matrix, and element forces

TrussElement Matlab:

Creates a set of nodes into a truss element
Provides the necessary inputs for the Assemble script to make stiffness matrix and element forces


For codes with hmwk 3 in the name, running the program will output the plots.
TrussElement and Assemble are not to be run and are functions to run in other scripts
