Details of Code:

Assemble Matlab:

Assembles stiffness matrix and force vector of element of system


curvedbeam Matlab:

Determines individual element stiffness and forces for a curved beam element


Hmwk6_p3_mesh... Matlab:

Solves curved beam with distributed load for different element mesh. Accounts for element locking.
Mesh# shows how many elements are in that mesh.


Hmwk6_p4_mesh4_straight Matlab:

Solves axially loaded beam problem with a straight beam. Accounts for element locking.


Hmwk5_p4_mesh..._straight Matlab:

Solves curved beam with axial load for different element mesh. Accounts for element locking.
Mesh# shows how many elements are in that mesh.
